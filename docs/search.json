    "text": "1 Introduction\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, average reading and math scores have steadily declined in the United States. Across almost all demographics, data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress reveals a steady downward trend in student performance on standardized reading and mathematics assessments. Average test scores among 13-year-olds in 2023 were the lowest in decades, 4 points lower in reading and 9 points lower in math than in 2019, respectively. Though this academic decline does not come as a complete surprise in the wake of school closures and online learning at the height of the pandemic, lower literacy and math skills have continued to drop across almost all demographic groups, including variations in age, gender, race, and region. We have chosen this topic for our final project to draw attention to this salient issue, highlight potential areas of achievement where students are struggling most, and contribute to the conversation of how to move forward in a post-pandemic world. For this project in particular, we are interested in exploring where academic achievement falls shortest across these demographics, with the ultimate goal of exploring which groups of students continue to be most disservice by the U.S. education system. We will examine how the downward trend of reading and math scores differs across the mentioned variables to understand which students were hit hardest by the transitions from in-classroom to online learning and back again. We are interested in studying the following questions: how does academic performance across the United States compare to pre-pandemic and even earlier performances? Which groups of students face the most difficulty in achieving pre-pandemic rates of academic achievement? Which groups of students are most at risk of education disparity if the current trends continue?",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe data source we use for this project is the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). The NAEP is a federal program under the US Department of Education that administers standardized tests typically every four years to test students’ reading and mathematics skills. The data we will use for this project is collected from the results of NAEP assessments administered from 1978 onwards. As the national evaluation is typically administered every four years, the frequency of the data is every four years. The data can be downloaded in a .xls format from the NAEP website, and we will convert them to a .csv format. The data can be downloaded by all years from 1978-2022 and by any of the following variables: all students, region of the country, gender, disability status (including 504 plan), disability status (excluding 504 plan), status as an English learner, race/ethnicity, public or private school, public or nonpublic school, National School Lunch program eligibility, and school location. For this project, we will focus on the following demographic variables: region of the country, gender, disability status, status as an English learner, race/ethnicity, National School Lunch program eligibility, and school location. Because the data can only be downloaded by one variable at a time, we will have to import separate CSV files for each of these datasets and then join them. We also know that data for all these demographics is not available for all years, so we anticipate narrowing the scope of our project in terms of time.\nhttps://www.nationsreportcard.gov/ndecore/xplore/ltt",

However, data in 2016 is missing for the disability category here, as well as in most of the other categories. The data begins being recorded in 2004. There are no records prior to that year either due to insufficient reporting standards or not being available.\n\n\n2.2.1.2 Gender\n\n\nCode\ngender &lt;- read_csv(\"data/mathematics/Mathematics, Age 9, Gender.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE, name_repair = 'minimal')\ncolnames(gender) &lt;- gender[8, 1:4]\ngender &lt;- gender[9:36, 1:4] |&gt;\n  mutate(Year = ymd(Year, truncated = 2L))\n\nggplot(gender, aes(x = Year, y = `Average scale score`, colour = Gender)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line(aes(group = Gender)) +\n  scale_x_date(breaks = as.Date(paste0(seq(1978, 2024, 4), \"-01-01\")), date_labels = \"%Y\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere appears to be missing data in 2016 in the gender category as well. There is also a vertical segment in the Male timeseries which is due to a transition from an “original” exam to a new exam version. The vertical segment reflects recorded values for the two versions of the exam in the same year. The scores for Female students were equivalent in both versions, so there is no vertical segment in that particular line graph.\nOther than 2016, there is no missing data set throughout 1978-2022. The fact that data is available for over four decades suggests that gender data is likely a critical component of the dataset and historically it has been prioritized compared to other metrics.\n\n\n2.2.1.3 National School\n\n\nCode\nnational_school &lt;- read_csv(\"data/mathematics/Mathematics, Age 9, National School.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE, name_repair = 'minimal')\ncolnames(national_school) &lt;- national_school[8, 1:4]\nnational_school &lt;- national_school[9:26, 1:4] |&gt;\n  mutate(Year = ymd(Year, truncated = 2L))\n\nggplot(national_school, aes(x = Year, y = `Average scale score`, colour = `National School Lunch Program eligibility, 3 categories`)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line(aes(group = `National School Lunch Program eligibility, 3 categories`)) +\n  scale_x_date(breaks = as.Date(paste0(seq(2004, 2024, 4), \"-01-01\")), date_labels = \"%Y\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#Missing Values in Mathematics National School Dataset\nnational_school &lt;- read_csv(\"data/mathematics/Mathematics, Age 9, National School.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE, name_repair = 'minimal')\n\ncolnames(national_school) &lt;- national_school[8, 1:4]\nnational_school &lt;- national_school[9:50, 1:4] |&gt;\n  mutate(Year = ymd(Year, truncated = 2L))\n\nnational_school &lt;- national_school|&gt;\n  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~na_if(., \"—\")))  \n\nmissing_values_national_school &lt;- sapply(national_school, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))\nprint(missing_values_national_school)\n\n\n                                                   Year \n                                                      0 \n                                           Jurisdiction \n                                                      0 \nNational School Lunch Program eligibility, 3 categories \n                                                      0 \n                                    Average scale score \n                                                     24 \n\n\nCode\ntotal_missing_national_school &lt;- sum(is.na(national_school))\nprint(paste(\"Total number of missing values in the national school dataset:\", total_missing_national_school))\n\n\n[1] \"Total number of missing values in the national school dataset: 24\"\n\n\nAgain we see vertical segments due to the transition between exam versions, and we also see missing data in 2016. Once again, data prior to 2004 is unavailable in this dataset resulting in 24 missing values in the Average Scale Score column.\n\n\n2.2.1.4 Race Ethnicity\n\n\nCode\nrace &lt;- read_csv(\"data/mathematics/Mathematics, Age 9, Race ethnicity.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE, name_repair = 'minimal')\ncolnames(race) &lt;- race[8, 1:4]\nrace &lt;- race[9:92, 1:4] |&gt;\n  mutate(Year = ymd(Year, truncated = 2L))\n\nggplot(race, aes(x = Year, y = `Average scale score`, colour = `Race/ethnicity (6 categories)`)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line(aes(group = `Race/ethnicity (6 categories)`)) +\n  scale_x_date(breaks = as.Date(paste0(seq(1978, 2024, 4), \"-01-01\")), date_labels = \"%Y\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph also contains vertical line segments at year 2004, as well as missing data in 2016. Another interesting thing to note here is the special character, which signifies that the reporting standards were not met, at the bottom of the y-axis. This primarily affects the Unclassified and American Indian or Alaska Native students.\n\n\nCode\n#Missing Values for Mathematics Race Data \nrace &lt;- race|&gt;\n  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~na_if(.,\"‡\")))\n\nmissing_values &lt;- sapply(race, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))\nprint(missing_values)\n\n\n                         Year                  Jurisdiction \n                            0                             0 \nRace/ethnicity (6 categories)           Average scale score \n                            0                            17 \n\n\nCode\ntotal_missing &lt;-sum(is.na(race))\nprint(paste(\"Total number of missing values in the dataset:\", total_missing))\n\n\n[1] \"Total number of missing values in the dataset: 17\"\n\n\nCode\nrace &lt;- race|&gt;\n  mutate(Year = ymd(Year, truncated = 2L)) \n\n\n\n\n2.2.1.5 School Region\n\n\nCode\nregion &lt;- read_csv(\"data/mathematics/Mathematics, Age 9, Region of the.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE, name_repair = 'minimal')\ncolnames(region) &lt;- region[8, 1:4]\nregion &lt;- region[9:37, 1:4] |&gt;\n  mutate(Year = ymd(Year, truncated = 2L))\n\nggplot(region, aes(x = Year, y =`Average scale score`, colour = `Region of the country`)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_line(aes(group = `Region of the country`)) +\n  scale_x_date(breaks = as.Date(paste0(seq(2004, 2024, 4), \"-01-01\")), date_labels = \"%Y\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#Missing data for Mathematics Region Dataset\nregion &lt;- read_csv(\"data/mathematics/Mathematics, Age 9, Region of the.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE, name_repair = 'minimal')\ncolnames(region) &lt;- region[8, 1:4]\nregion &lt;- region[9:78, 1:4] |&gt;\n  mutate(Year = ymd(Year, truncated = 2L))\n\nregion &lt;- region |&gt;\n  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~na_if(., \"—\"))) |&gt;\n  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~na_if(., \"‡\")))\n\nmissing_values_region &lt;- sapply(region, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))\nprint(missing_values_region)\n\n\n                 Year          Jurisdiction Region of the country \n                    0                     0                     0 \n  Average scale score \n                   46 \n\n\nCode\ntotal_missing_region &lt;- sum(is.na(region))\nprint(paste(\"Total number of missing values in the region dataset:\", total_missing_region))\n\n\n[1] \"Total number of missing values in the region dataset: 46\"\n\n\nHere we see the same missing data patterns as before: vertical segments at 2004, missing data in 2016, and reporting standards not met for the DoDEA International region of the country.

Missing values are typically encountered in earlier years suggesting that data collection methods or reporting standards may not have been as consistent in those periods.\nSome datasets, like the gender or region datasets, show almost complete data coverage, while others (e.g., the 2016 year in some datasets) have isolated instances of missing values.
